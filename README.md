# Matrix-Compiler-Exercise

## Description
Simple exercise to demonstrate compiling of matrix lines and characters.

## Objective
Compiler should run through each character of each line to read/gather the series of 1's and 0's.
If the compiler finds a 1 in the series, each character in the series should change to 1.
Additionally, every column position where the 1 was found should update to value of 1.
